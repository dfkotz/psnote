# psnote
## AUTHOR: Darren Vengroff

## ABOUT:

psnote is a tool for annotating PS files with text and/or graphics.
It is useful for noting such things as what conference proceedings or
journal a paper appeared in, where it is available on the web, and
who holds the copyright.  It can also be used to place watermarks or
letterhead underneath the text of a document before printing.

psnote is a perl script, so you need a system that has perl to run it.
psnote is not 100% foolproof.  It relies heavily on correctly
constructed structuring comments in the PS source it works with.

psnote was written by Darren Erik Vengroff <dev@cs.duke.edu>, to whom
questions and/or bug reports should be addressed.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Installing psnote is quite simple.

First, edit the executable script psnote.  The only thing you should
have to change is the very first line, which should point to where
perl is installed on your system.

Now copy psnote to a convenient place on your path, such as
/usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/.  Copy psnote.1 to a directory called man1/
in a directory on your MANPATH, such as /usr/local/man/ or ~/man/.

That's it.  You are now ready to use psnote.  The only other thing you
might have to do is rehash, so you're shell knows where to find
psnote.
